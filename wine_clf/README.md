# Machine-Learning
This is a machine learning project on classification problem, specifically wine classification based on the dataset wine.csv
## Wine classification
### Problems such as first processing based on dimensionality reduction model of PCA data:  
- Analysis of principal components based on predictive model of random binary forest.
- Finally normalizing scaler data for PCA model.
### KNN classification model
- KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) is one of the simplest supervised learning algorithms widely used in data mining and machine learning.
- The idea of this algorithm is that it doesn't learn anything from the learning dataset (so KNN is classified as lazy learning), all computations are performed when it needs to predict the labels of new data.
- The class (label) of a new data object can be predicted from the classes (labels) of its k nearest neighbors.
